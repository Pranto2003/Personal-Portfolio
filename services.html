        <h3>Full-Stack Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          I specialize in creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web
          applications. Leveraging the power of the MERN stack (MongoDB,
          Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I build end-to-end solutions that
          seamlessly integrate the front-end and back-end. From database
          architecture to user interface design, I ensure every aspect of your
          web application is finely tuned to meet your needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Front-End Development</h3>
        <p>
          I craft visually appealing and highly interactive user interfaces
          using React.js. My focus is on delivering a smooth and intuitive user
          experience, with a keen eye for design and detail. Whether itâ€™s a
          single-page application or a complex web portal, I ensure that your
          users enjoy a flawless experience across all devices.
        </p>

        <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
        <p>
          With extensive experience in Node.js and Express.js, I develop robust
          and scalable server-side applications. My services include API
          development, server configuration, and database management using
          MongoDB. I ensure that your web application runs smoothly,
          efficiently, and securely.
        </p>

        <h3>API Development & Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Need custom APIs or integrating third-party services? I develop
          RESTful APIs that are secure, efficient, and easy to integrate.
          Whether it's connecting your application with external services or
          creating custom endpoints, I ensure that data flows seamlessly across
          your systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Database Design & Management</h3>
        <p>
          I design and manage databases that are optimized for performance,
          scalability, and security. Using MongoDB, I create flexible data
          models that suit your application's needs, ensuring data integrity and
          fast query performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Maintenance & Support</h3>
        <p>
          Your website deserves ongoing attention to stay up-to-date and perform
          optimally. I provide continuous maintenance, updates, and support
          services to keep your web application running smoothly, address any
          issues that arise, and implement new features as your needs grow.
